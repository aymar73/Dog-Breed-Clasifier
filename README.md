# Dog-Breed-Clasifier
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks  - Transfer Learning...Built an algorithm to identify canine breed given an image of a dog. If given image of a human, the algorithm identifies a resembling dog breed.

## Running (Linux/Mac/ + git + conda)

If you want to run the notebook on your own (using anaconda)

    git clone https://github.com/aymar73/Dog-Breed-Clasifier/Dog-Breed-Clasifier.git
    cd Dog-Breed-Clasifier
    # Create a conda environment if you want or use one you already have
    conda create --name YOUR_ENV_NAME python=3
    source activate YOUR_ENV_NAME
    conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook
    jupyter notebook Dog-Breed-Clasifier.ipynb
    
The notebook is also rendered by github, so you can simply click on the file Your_first_neural_network.ipynb here and you will see my results.
